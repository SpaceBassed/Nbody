# Nbody
Rewriting an older project to simulate n-body systems in javascript to meet my current code standards. Primary goal is to improve overall efficiency of the program and remove issues such as hardcoded variables to increase code and simulation modularity. Will potentially expand scope of original project to add features, but currently not a focus.
